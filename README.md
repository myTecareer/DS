Distributed system project smartBuingProject
The focus of this project is the smart tracking of indoor air pollution. Good air quality is a precondition to ensuring people live and work healthily. Observing and monitoring your air quality in real-time can improve employee satisfaction and reduce healthcare costs. Therefore, in the smart building project, the following three services can meet the basic needs of the customer: the first is the smart building environmental control service, the second is the smart air quality control service, and the third is the health statistics service.
The smart building environment control service contains two methods of temperature control and humidity check, which users can check and modify at any time on their cell phones according to their needs. The smart air quality service contains feedback on current air quality and the opening and closing of the air purifier. Users can check the current air quality at any time, and the air purifier will open at any time according to the user's choice, or open automatically according to the current air quality. The health statistics service provides feedback on the air condition of the whole building and provides early warning of potential dangers at any time, making it easy for users to take necessary actions immediately.
